1.  As we all learned that when every we use "new" keyword to allocated memery, we need to call "delete" keyword
    to delete allocated memery. Smart poniter saved us process to delete. Smart pointers can automatically delete 
    memery allocated.

    std::unique_ptr<EmployeeWage> ew(new EmployeeWage(emp[i].name, sal[j].salary));
    when this unique_ptr is ceated, it will live until the end of its current scope and get destroyed.


2.  the difference between raw pinter and smart pointer is that smart pointer cannot be copied.
    when passing it in a function, you need to pass it in using reference.

    for instance:

    // TODO: Overload the += operator with a smart pointer
		//  as a second operand.
		void operator+=(T &obj)
		{
			list.push_back(obj);
		}

		// TODO: Overload the += operator with a raw pointer
		//  as a second operand.
		void operator+=(T *obj)
		{
			list.push_back(*obj);
		}
