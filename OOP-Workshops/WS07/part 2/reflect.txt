1.  In this workshop I have used "sort", "replace_if", "any_of" and "copy_if"
    from the SLT functions.
    All those functions, you must define the ranged using "begin()", and "end()".
    then you must define the condition of return.  

2.  One thing that I notice is that it shorts the code we need to write. 
    you dont need to define the range of the loop, and datails happend inside the loop.
    All we need to do is write some parameters and lambda expression to specify the condition.


3.  What we can do is that, we can use "else" to specify if those conditions didnt match 
    , what we want the program to do. 

    what I have for the sort function is :

    void CovidCollection::sort(const std::string &params)
    {
        std::sort(m_Covid.begin(), m_Covid.end(), [&params](const Covid &c1, const Covid &c2)
                  {
				if (params == "country") return c1.m_country < c2.m_country;
				else if (params == "variant") return c1.m_varient < c2.m_varient;
				else if (params == "cases") return c1.m_numOfCases < c2.m_numOfCases;
				else if (params == "deaths") return c1.m_numOfDeath < c2.m_numOfDeath; });
    }


    for instance, if the params input is invalid, we can set the program to sort based on 
    city.

    simply add "else {return c1.m_city > c2.m_city}"  below the last else if statement.
